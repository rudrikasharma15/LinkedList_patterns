## **Linked List Patterns**

### **Pattern 1: Basics (Traversal & Building)**

* Learn to **create, traverse, and delete** nodes.

1. Implement Singly Linked List (Insert, Delete, Print).
2. Implement Doubly Linked List.
3. Implement Circular Linked List.

### **Pattern 2: Reversal Variations**

Master reversal — the most common interview pattern.
4\. Reverse a Linked List (Iterative).
5\. Reverse a Linked List (Recursive).
6\. Reverse a Doubly Linked List.
7\. Reverse a Sublist (Between m and n).
8\. Reverse in Groups of k.
9\. Reverse Nodes Alternately.

---

### **Pattern 3: Fast & Slow Pointers (Cycle + Middle)**

Classic technique for **cycle detection, middle finding**.
10\. Detect Cycle.
11\. Find Cycle Start Node.
12\. Length of Cycle.
13\. Find Middle of List (Odd/Even).
14\. Delete Middle Node.
15\. Check Palindrome (using slow/fast & reverse half).

---

### **Pattern 4: Merge & Sorting**

All problems where lists are combined or sorted.
16\. Merge Two Sorted Lists.
17\. Merge K Sorted Lists (Heap).
18\. Sort List (Merge Sort).
19\. Insertion Sort List.
20\. Partition List around a value x.

---

### **Pattern 5: Two-Pointer Tricks**

Common in interview puzzles.
21\. Remove Nth Node from End.
22\. Intersection of Two Lists.
23\. Add Two Numbers (carry handling).
24\. Add Two Numbers II (without reversing).
25\. Split Linked List into Parts.

---

### **Pattern 6: Dummy Node Usage**

Learn to use a dummy node to simplify pointer management.
26\. Remove Elements (all occurrences).
27\. Remove Duplicates from Sorted List.
28\. Remove Duplicates from Sorted List II.
29\. Odd-Even Linked List.
30\. Swap Nodes in Pairs.

---

### **Pattern 7: Backtracking with Linked List**

Rare but seen in advanced coding rounds.
31\. Generate all permutations stored as linked lists.
32\. Reverse Linked List to produce all possible paths in recursion.

---

### **Pattern 8: Multilevel & Advanced Structures**

Covers uncommon but tough ones.
33\. Flatten a Multilevel Doubly Linked List.
34\. Copy List with Random Pointer.
35\. Clone a Linked List with Random/Arbitrary Pointers (without extra space).

---

### **Pattern 9: Stack + Linked List Combo**

Stack technique appears in some problems.
36\. Next Greater Node in Linked List.
37\. Add Two Numbers (stack approach).
38\. Remove Nodes Greater than Right Side (Monotonic stack).

---

### **Pattern 10: Advanced Practice (Hard/Edge Cases)**

39. Reverse Nodes in K-Group (hard variant).
40. LFU/LRU Cache (requires doubly linked list + hashmap).
41. Rotate List.
42. Delete Duplicates (unsorted list).
43. Linked List Components (count groups).

### **How to Practice (Daily Plan to Hit 100):**

1. Do **5–7 patterns per day** (with variations) → \~15 problems/day.
2. By **Day 7**, you’ll cover all **patterns + 100 problems solved**.
3. Revisit the **tricky ones (like k-group, LFU cache)** on Day 7.
